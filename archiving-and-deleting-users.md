# Help Guide: Archiving vs Deleting Users

Archiving keeps a user’s information and check-in history hidden but recoverable.  
Deleting removes the user permanently along with all check-ins and roster links.  
Because deletion can’t be undone, archiving is almost always the safer option.

## Why Choose Archiving?

- **Preserves historical data** – The user’s attendance and roster associations remain intact but are no longer visible in day‑to‑day lists.
- **Easily reversible** – Archived users appear under **"Archived Users"** in the Roster Management page, where you can restore them at any time.
- **Cleaner reports** – Archived users are excluded from standard roster exports and email reports unless you choose to include them.

## Risks of Deleting

- **Permanent** – Deletion removes the user record and all associated check‑ins from the database.
- **No recovery** – Once deleted, you can’t restore that user or their attendance history.
- **Manual confirmation** – The app requires you to type `"DELETE"` in the confirmation modal to help prevent accidental removal.

## Recommended Workflow

### Archive when athletes leave

Use the **“Archive”** button on the Roster Management page. This hides the user from your active lists but retains their history.

### Restore if they return

Go to the **“Archived Users”** tab, find the athlete, and click **Restore**.

### Delete only in rare cases

If you must erase a user entirely (for example, at their request), confirm the deletion in the modal and understand it can’t be undone.

By archiving first, you maintain accurate attendance records and can easily reactivate athletes if they come back to your program.  
**Deleting should only be used when you’re certain the data is no longer needed.**
