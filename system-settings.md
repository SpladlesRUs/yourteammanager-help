# System Settings and Themes

System Settings control application‑wide defaults. Access them from the Admin Dashboard under **System Settings**.

## Default Roster and ID Type

- **Default Roster** – new check‑ins and self‑registrations use this roster unless specified otherwise.
- **Default ID Type** – the label for athlete IDs when creating rosters or importing CSV files.

## BJJ Belt Rankings

Enable belt ranking to track promotions for Brazilian Jiu‑Jitsu, Judo, etc programs. When turned on, each roster gains subrosters for standard White through Black belts.

## Self Registration

Allow athletes to register themselves via a public link. You can restrict registration to a single roster or allow selecting subrosters.

## Themes

Both the system and individual rosters have theme settings:

- Background, text and box colours
- Clock colour and icon set
- Custom fonts and logo

Adjust these to match your team branding. Rosters inherit the system theme unless customised.
