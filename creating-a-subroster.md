# Steps to Create a Subroster

## 1. Open Roster Management

From the **Admin Dashboard**, select **Roster Management** and choose the roster you want to organize.

## 2. Navigate to Subrosters

With a roster selected, click **Subrosters**. This shows any existing subrosters (or indicates none are present).

## 3. Add a Subroster

Click **Add Subroster** and enter a name. Examples include *Under-10*, *Heavyweight*, or *Blue Belt*.

- If **BJJ belt ranking** is enabled, you’ll see belt colors listed automatically.
- You can use these defaults or create additional categories.

## 4. Assign Athletes

Edit an athlete’s profile and select their subroster from the dropdown.  
They can belong to **multiple subrosters** if needed.

## 5. Save Your Changes

Once saved, athletes appear in **attendance** and **reports** with both their roster and subroster listed.

Using subrosters keeps your roster organized, makes check-in reports easier to filter, and allows coaches to focus on specific groups.  
Adjust subrosters at any time as your team grows or changes.
