# Backup and Restore

Keeping a copy of your data ensures you can recover from hardware failures or mistakes. The Backup & Restore page is available from **System Settings**.

## Creating a Backup

1. Click **Download Backup** to save a snapshot of the database as a `.sql` file.
2. Store backups in a safe location.

## Restoring

1. Click **Upload Backup** and select a previously downloaded file.
2. The server will replace all current data with the contents of the backup.
3. A **Full Reset** option is also provided to wipe rosters, checkâ€‘ins and admins so you can run the Welcome Wizard again.

**Warning:** Restoring or resetting cannot be undone.
