# Rosters vs Subrosters

Rosters group athletes based on a common theme.  

Subrosters divide athletes within a roster into categories, such as weight classes or BJJ belt colors.

## When should I use a Roster vs a Subroster?

If you answer yes to any of these questions, you should create a new Roster (instead of only a Subroster):

- Do these athletes practice at a different location or on a different schedule than your main team?
- Do you need to track attendance and reports for this group completely separate from other athletes?
- Will you use a different ID type or membership number for these athletes (e.g., USA Wrestling ID vs a custom Student ID)?
- Do these athletes compete in a different league or season that is distinct from your existing roster?
- Do you want to restrict coaches’ or admins’ access to this group’s data separately?
- Would it be confusing for these athletes to share the same check‑in list with your existing roster?

If your answer is no to all of the above, you can usually create a Subroster within an existing roster. Subrosters are best for organizing athletes inside one roster by belt level, weight class, age group, or any other internal grouping, while attendance and ID rules remain the same across the roster.
