# Creating a Roster

The roster system groups athletes and determines where check‑ins are recorded. Subrosters (like BJJ belt levels or weight classes) can be added later for further organization.

## Steps to Create a Roster

1. Navigate to **Roster Management** in the **Admin Dashboard**.
2. Click **Add Roster** and enter a name.
3. Select the ID type used for new athletes (e.g. USA Wrestling ID). You can set a default ID in **System Settings**.
4. Decide if the roster will use BJJ belt rankings.

Once a roster is created, you can:

- Edit its name or ID type at any time.
- Delete it (this also removes its subrosters and check-ins).

## ID Options

The application offers several predefined ID types, organized into groups:

- **Wrestling ID Types** – USA Wrestling ID and AAU ID  
- **Grappling/BJJ ID Types** – USA Grappling ID and IBJJF ID  
- **Other** – Other Unique ID (Student ID, Phone number, etc)

These values populate the roster creation drop‑down.

If you select **Other Unique ID**, you can specify your own label (e.g. “Student ID”) in the roster form.  
The chosen ID type becomes the label for athlete IDs on forms, CSV imports, and email reports.

## System Default ID Type

Under **System Settings**, you can set:

- A default roster
- A default ID type

New rosters will prefill with this ID label, and CSV imports use it for the ID column header.
