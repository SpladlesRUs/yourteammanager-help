# Tracking Attendance

The Check‑In page is the primary interface for recording who attends practice. Athletes can scan a QR code or you can manually enter their ID.

## Checking In

1. Select the desired roster at the top of the page.
2. Enter an athlete's ID or scan their code.
3. If the athlete belongs to multiple subrosters you can choose which one to credit.
4. Successful check‑ins will appear in the history list on the admin panel.

## Viewing History

Use **Athlete Reports** > **Check‑In History** to review past attendance. Filter by roster or date to narrow the results. Each entry shows the athlete, roster, and timestamp.

## Exporting Data

Roster Management includes an **Export Roster** button which downloads the current roster and attendance as a CSV file.
