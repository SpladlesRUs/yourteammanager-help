# Managing Rosters and Subrosters

Rosters group your athletes and determine where check‑ins are recorded. Each roster can have optional subrosters for further organisation (for example, separating coaches from athletes or tracking belt levels).

## Creating a Roster

1. Navigate to **Roster Management** in the Admin Dashboard.
2. Click **Add Roster** and enter a name.
3. Select the ID type used for new athletes (e.g. USA Wrestling ID). You can set a default in System Settings.
4. Decide if the roster will use BJJ belt rankings.

## Editing and Deleting

- Click a roster row to edit its name or ID type.
- Use the **Delete** button to remove a roster. This also removes any associated subrosters and check‑ins.

## Subrosters

Subrosters let you divide a roster into categories. Examples include weight classes or BJJ belt colors.

1. In **Roster Management** select a roster, then choose **Subrosters**.
2. Add new subrosters with the **Add Subroster** button.
3. Assign athletes by editing a user and selecting their subroster(s).

A roster using BJJ rankings automatically creates subrosters for each belt. Turning rankings off will remove them.
